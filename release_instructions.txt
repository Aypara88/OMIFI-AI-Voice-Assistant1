# OMIFI Voice Assistant - Download & Installation Instructions

## Overview 
OMIFI is experiencing limitations in the Replit environment because cloud-based servers cannot directly access your local microphone, clipboard, or screen. For truly advanced Siri-like voice recognition that works with your actual PC hardware in real-time, you need to download and run OMIFI locally.

## Why Local Installation Is Required for Advanced Features

The web version of OMIFI running on Replit has several limitations:

1. **Real-time Voice Recognition**: Replit's servers don't have physical microphones attached, so they can't directly listen to your voice commands.

2. **Advanced Speech Processing**: True Siri-like functionality requires processing audio directly from your hardware with minimal latency.

3. **System Integration**: Running locally allows OMIFI to integrate with your operating system for persistent background listening and immediate response.

4. **Privacy and Performance**: Local processing keeps your voice data on your own machine and eliminates network delays.

## Download Instructions

1. Download the complete source code using the "Download as ZIP" button at the top of this Replit page.

2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

3. Install the required dependencies by running:
```
pip install Flask==2.2.3 flask-sqlalchemy==3.0.3 gunicorn==23.0.0 Pillow==9.4.0 PyAudio==0.2.13 PyQt5==5.15.9 pyperclip==1.8.2 pyttsx3==2.90 qrcode==7.4.2 SpeechRecognition==3.10.0
```

4. If you have trouble installing PyAudio:
   - Windows: Try `pip install pipwin` then `pipwin install pyaudio`
   - macOS: Install portaudio with `brew install portaudio` first
   - Linux: Install portaudio development package first (e.g., `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev`)

## Running OMIFI Locally

1. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder.

2. Run OMIFI with: `python main.py`

3. You should see the OMIFI icon appear in your system tray.

4. Try saying "Hey OMIFI, take a screenshot" to test voice recognition.

5. You can also access the web dashboard at http://localhost:5000

## Troubleshooting

If voice recognition isn't working:
1. Make sure your microphone is working and properly connected
2. Check if your system has granted microphone permissions to Python/OMIFI
3. Try running as administrator (on Windows) for better hardware access
4. If you see PyAudio or PortAudio errors, follow the installation instructions above
